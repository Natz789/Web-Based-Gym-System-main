🧩 New Feature Summary

Goal: Improve staff functionality, payment flow, and admin controls.

👥 Staff Dashboard

Create a dedicated dashboard for staff users.

Staff can:

Handle walk-in payments.

View payment history (walk-ins + membership plans).

Add new members to the system.

🛠️ Admin Dashboard Update

In the Member List section, allow admins to create new staff accounts (assign staff role, credentials, etc.).

💳 Payment Logic Update

Add a payment confirmation layout before finalizing transactions (both walk-ins and memberships).

For GCash payments, replace API integration with a QR code payment section where users can scan to pay manually.

✅ Expected Outcome

A more structured workflow:

Staff manage on-site transactions easily.

Admins can manage both members and staff.

Payments are confirmed visually and securely.

GCash is simplified through QR-based payments.
